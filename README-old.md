# Weekly Planner

This project will be a weekly planner app, similar to what I have already created as a template for in Notion, but it will consume less power and RAM (fuck Electron apps).

An example of the UI I have planned can be found underneath:

<div align="center"> 
<img src="docs/images/ui-example.png"
     alt="Example of UI, pulled from my Notion page"
     style="float: center; margin-right: 10px;" width = 550px/>
</div>
<!-- 
![UI example](docs/images/ui-example.png "UI Example") -->

Functionality that sets it apart from the example project:

<ul>
  <li>Time Estimates for each task</li>
  <li>Similar to <a href="https://github.com/johannesjo/super-productivity">super-productivity</a> in that u can plan your day and it will keep track of pomodoro timers.</li>
  <li>When a day is "over", uncompleted tasks will be moved to next day</li>
  <li>The app will save the task, time spent/remaining etc to a separate file</li>
  <li>It will look better and cooler, and will be useful.</li>
  
</ul>
